# impulse
ðŸ‘‹ Hello developer!
This project contains a basic HTML page to get you started for what next is coming.

I seek permission to speak freely or rather tend to the subconscious, the journey to creating this project was rather a fast and furious one. The pages comprises of HTML and CSS semantics. The CSS had an external, internal and inline placment with the HTML. The HTML had the necessary elements and attributes to qualify the page feasible.


The pages in this project were created by combined efforts of friends in persons of Ibitein, Ayomide, Damilare, Olayiwola, Mofe and others that I cannot mention but appreciate for the good wishes, push factor and support(aware or unaware. Also i would like to appreciate 14G Zuri Training for the preliminary training that lead to this.

I took up this project with hopes to boost my Front-End Web development skills to a professional level, hence as the name implies, "impulse". 

In concusion, i would advice, In coding it does not hurt to ask for assistance.
Until next time, Au revoir!
